This is the hw assignment "Stack using Array". 
The code that was given was fully funcitonal. 
Due to this I reviewed the code and was able to see what exactly each part was doing. 
I did add the peek method in order to test the peek method. 
In this peek method I peek at the last element then remove elemenets and peek again.
The results were as expected and the peek method worked fine. 
I did have to edit the main code to overide the peek method with element T.
